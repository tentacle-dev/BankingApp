## Installation

1. **Install Expo CLI globally** (if you don't have it installed):

   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```

2. **Create a new Expo project**:

   ```bash
   npx create-expo-app BankingApp

## Run the Project

### **To run on Android:**

```bash
npm run android
```

### **To run on iOS:**

```bash
npm run ios
```

### **To run on Web:**

```bash
npm run web
```

### **Running all platforms together:**

The most efficient way to run all platforms simultaneously is by starting Expo's development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Once the server starts, open the Expo app on your mobile device and scan the QR code shown in the terminal. It will automatically open the app on your mobile device. Give it some time, and voila!
